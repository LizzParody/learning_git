#Learning git

Git is a version control tool that saves changes to groups of files that you can revert back if needed.

##There are three types of version control:

1. Local version control: saves files to a database on my local computer.
2. Centralized version control: saves changes to a share server
3. Distributed version control: which allows for easy sharing files (because you will be able to share them and eliminates problems that could occur with a server lost)

Complete back ups of everything.

##Files transition between 3 states:
1. Modified files: files that are recently changed.
2. Staged files: files that are marked to be saved.
3. Commited files: files that have been saved.

Git saves all this changes to a directory and then I will be able to modify those files in what is called working directory.

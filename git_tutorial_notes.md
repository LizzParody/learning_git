#Learning git

Git is a version control tool that saves changes to groups of files that you can revert back if needed.

###There are three types of version control:

1. Local version control: saves files to a database on my local computer.
2. Centralized version control: saves changes to a shared server.
3. Distributed version control:  allows many software developers to work on a given project without requiring them to share a common network. 

Complete back ups of everything.

###Files transition between 3 states:
1. Modified files: files that are recently changed.
2. Staged files: files that are marked to be saved.
3. Commited files: files that have been saved.

Git saves all this changes to a directory and then I will be able to modify those files in what is called working directory.

#In the terminal
```
lizparody$ git config --global core.editor "vim" // to configure the editor
```

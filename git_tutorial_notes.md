git is a version control tool that saves changes to groups of files that you can revert back if needed.

Three types of version control:

1. Local version control: saves files to a database on my local computer.
2. Centralized version control: saves changes to a share server
3. Distributed version control: which allows for easy sharing files (because you will be able to share them and eliminates problems that could occur with a server lost)

Complete back ups of everything.
